<h3 id="description_mapping-vs-unmapping">Mapping vs. unmapping</h3>
<p>Within this documentation, you will see contents about both mapping and unmapping. <strong>Mapping</strong> is the process to get a value out from a field, while <strong>unmapping</strong> is setting the value on it.</p>
<h3 id="description_unmapping-process">Unmapping process</h3>
<p>The unmapping process starts usually when a user performs changes on an input&#39;s value. Native forms contain automatic behaviors for handling data changes, calling this unmapping process beneath them. However, if you deal with custom forms, you will need to define your own handlers for data changes, for manually triggering the unmapping process.</p>
