 * # Konga's API Reference
 *
 * Welcome to Konga's API Reference. Here you got all the documentation, about everything Konga does and gives you. Here you can see a brief introduction about what you can find in each section.
 *
 * ## Metadata
 *
 * This section defines everything `konga-metadata` contains, and what each property and parameter means, and does:
 *
 * * **<i class="fa fa-wrench"></i> Definitions:** Definitions contain individual or grouped properties to configure your metadata. Some of these properties are interpreted by the `ui` giving a more meaningful context to the forms and the interactions engaged with them.
 * * **<i class="fa fa-tag"></i> Enumerations:** Enumerations contain the set of allowed parameters for the properties bound to them.
 * * **<i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> Generators:** Documents the available methods for generating your metadata.
 * * **<i class="fa fa-key"></i> Permissions:** Learn here how to engage your Konga app with a rich permission system to restrict access at both entity and field levels.
 *
 * ## Standards
 *
 * Documentation on standard features. {@link Standards Standard features} are enough for building a full-working app, connected to an API. These are the main standard features:
 *
 * * **<i class="Modeling:** Define how your metadata is interpreted to build your {@link Standards.Apps `Apps`} and {@link Standards.Forms `Forms`}.
